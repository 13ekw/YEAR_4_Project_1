# YEAR_4_Project_1

This repo contains all the files for the SCIFM0004 Accelerated - Computing Mini Project 1 - The Lebwohl-Lasher Model of Liquid Crystals.

We were provided with Lebwohl Lasher python code and were meant to accelerate the code using various techinques including the following:
- Port the code to mpi4py and run on multiple cores;
- Cythonize individual functions and attempt to apply multithreading techniques;
- See what opportunities exist for using NumPy vectorization to speed the calculations (can you switch from random to sequential sampling to aid this?);
- Experiment with Numba and see what speed-ups are possible.

It also contains a test_Lebwohl_Lasher python file for pytesting the outputs

This project has also been written up in a report which can br requested from Emily Wright.
